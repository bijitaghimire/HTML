The two major units are relative and absolute unit. Talking about the location of style,the inline style lies within the HTML element.Embedded style sheets (also called internal styles) are style rules placed within the <style></style> element.External style sheets are style rules placed within a external text file with the css extension .The types of selectors include Elements selectors containing all HTML elements. A class selector allows you to simultaneously target different HTML elements regardless of their position .ID selector targets specific elements whereas an attribute selector provides a way to select HTML elements either by the presence of an element attribute or its value.The page construction can be done by CSS or HTML and the elements are header,nev,article,aside and footer,and fluid design for the layout.
